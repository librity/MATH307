    "## Re-using the A=PLU factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "In some situations we can re-use the A=PLU factorization in multiple problems. An example is solving a boundary value problem for several different boundary conditions. We describe a example of this: the discrete Dirichlet problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "If $X$ is a finite (or countably infinite) set we define \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note 1: If $X$ is finite then the sum in the definition always converges so $\\ell^2(X)$ actually contains _all_ functions from $X\\rightarrow \\mathbb C$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note 2: We can equally well consider real valued function $X\\rightarrow \\mathbb R$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note 3: When $f,g \\in \\ell^2(X)$ then the inner (dot) product \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\langle f, g \\rangle = \\sum_{x\\in X} \\overline f_x g_x \n",
    "$$\n",
    "is well defined (ie converges) Again obvious if $X$ is finite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: if $X=[0,1,2,3]$ then a function $f:X\\rightarrow \\mathbb C$ is simply an assignment of a number $f_i$ to every $i\\in X$, ie a vector $\\begin{bmatrix}f_0\\\\f_1\\\\f_2\\\\f_3\\\\\\end{bmatrix} \\in \\mathbb C^4$\n",
